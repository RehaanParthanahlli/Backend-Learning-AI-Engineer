# 🌐 Networking Basics

## IP Address
- Unique identifier for a device on a network.
- Types:
  - IPv4: 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
  - IPv6: 128-bit (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

## Static IP
- Manually assigned, does not change.
- Useful for servers, hosting, and devices needing a permanent address.
- Example: A company web server with fixed IP.

## Dynamic IP
- Assigned automatically by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
- Changes over time or when reconnecting.
- Common for home users and mobile devices.

## DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates domain names into IP addresses.
- Process:
  1. Browser/OS checks cache.
  2. Query sent to DNS resolver.
  3. Resolver contacts:
     - Root servers → TLD servers (.com, .org, etc.)
     - Authoritative servers → final IP address.
  4. Result cached for faster future lookups.
- Example: google.com → 142.250.190.14

## DHCP
- Protocol that automatically assigns:
  - IP address (usually dynamic)
  - Subnet mask
  - Default gateway
  - DNS server
- Saves manual configuration effort.

## Quick Comparison
- IP Address: Device identifier (number).
- DNS: Converts names → numbers.
- Static IP: Fixed, manual.
- Dynamic IP: Temporary, automatic.
- DHCP: Service that manages dynamic assignment.
