EC2 is like renting apartments in a huge skyscraper:
- Each apartment = an EC2 instance (virtual server).
- You choose the size/layout = instance type (CPU, RAM, storage).
- You furnish it = Amazon Machine Image (AMI, OS + software).
- You pay rent only for the time you use it = on-demand pricing.
- You can rent more apartments during peak season = scaling up.
- You can vacate them when not needed = scaling down.
