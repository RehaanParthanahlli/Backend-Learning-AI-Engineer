### Cloud Service Models

**1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- Provides raw computing resources: servers, storage, networking.
- You manage the operating system, apps, and data.
- Example: 
  - AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - Azure Virtual Machines
- Analogy: Renting an empty apartment — you bring your own furniture (apps, OS).

---

**2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- Provides a ready-to-use platform for building and running applications.
- You don’t worry about servers or OS; just focus on coding and deploying.
- Example:
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Azure App Service
- Analogy: Renting a furnished apartment — you just move in and start living (deploy apps).

---

**3. SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- Provides complete software applications delivered over the internet.
- No need to install, maintain, or manage anything — just use the app.
- Example:
  - Microsoft 365 (Azure)
  - Amazon WorkMail (AWS)
  - Salesforce, Zoom, Google Workspace
- Analogy: Staying in a hotel — everything is ready, you just use the service.

### How These Services Help
- **Scalability**: Easily add more resources or users without buying hardware.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the right model depending on whether you need raw infrastructure, a development platform, or ready-made apps.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Global Reach**: Services are available worldwide, close to your users.

**In short:**  
- **IaaS** = raw building blocks (servers, storage).  
- **PaaS** = ready platform for developers.  
- **SaaS** = finished apps for end users.
