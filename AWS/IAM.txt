Note -
    IAM is a core part of Cloud computing n Infrastructure.
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that organizations use to manage digital identities and control user access to critical resources.

Imagine your company is like a big house: 

- **Identity Management** = The guest list. 
  (Who is allowed to enter? Employees, contractors, partners.)

- **Authentication** = The front door lock. 
  (How do guests prove they belong? Keys, passwords, fingerprints.)

- **Authorization** = The room permissions. 
  (Once inside, which rooms can they enter? Kitchen for chefs, office for managers.)

- **Access Policies** = The house rules. 
  (Guests can only enter during certain hours, or only with supervision.)

- **Auditing & Compliance** = The CCTV cameras and visitor logbook. 
  (Tracking who entered, when, and what they did.)

So IAM is not the *walls* or *fence* (that’s the firewall), 
IAM is the *guest management system* that ensures the right people 
get in and only go where they’re supposed to.
