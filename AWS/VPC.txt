    Virtual Private Cloud

Think of a VPC as designing your own private neighborhood in the cloud:

1. **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** = The city boundary.
   - Defines the overall address range for your neighborhood.
   - Example: 10.0.0.0/16 → gives you 65,536 possible house numbers (IP addresses).

2. **Subnets** = The streets inside your neighborhood.
   - You carve the big CIDR block into smaller chunks (subnets).
   - Example: 10.0.1.0/24 → one street with 256 houses (IPs).
   - Subnets can be public (connected to the internet) or private (internal only).

3. **Route Tables** = The road maps.
   - Decide how traffic flows between subnets and outside the neighborhood.
   - Example: Cars (packets) from private subnet must go through NAT to reach the city.

4. **Internet Gateway (IGW) / NAT Gateway** = The main gates.
   - IGW = The front gate to the city (internet). Public subnets use this.
   - NAT = A back gate that lets private houses send mail out, but outsiders can’t enter.

5. **Security Groups (SG)** = Guards at each house.
   - Control who can knock on the door (inbound) and what can leave (outbound).
   - Example: Allow SSH (port 22) only from your laptop’s IP.

6. **Network ACLs (NACLs)** = The neighborhood fence.
   - Rules applied at the street level (subnet).
   - Example: Block all traffic from a suspicious region before it even reaches houses.

Putting it together:
- CIDR defines the neighborhood size.
- Subnets divide it into streets.
- Route tables decide traffic flow.
- IGW/NAT are the gates to the outside world.
- SGs guard individual houses.
- NACLs guard entire streets.
