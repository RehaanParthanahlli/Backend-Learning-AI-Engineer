            # Key Differentiation
            - LLM = A type of GenAI specialized in text.
            - GenAI = Umbrella term for all generative systems (text, image, audio, video).
            - Agentic AI = Builds on GenAI/LLMs, adds autonomy, tool usage, and goal-oriented workflows.
            - Other AI = Broader ML/DL techniques that may classify, predict, or optimize rather than generate.

            👉 All LLMs are GenAI, but not all GenAI are LLMs.  
            👉 Agentic AI is GenAI taken further — autonomous, tool-using, and goal-driven.

# Difference between GenAI & Agentic AI

            When GenAI (like an LLM or multimodal model) is simply generating text, images, or audio, it’s still just generative.
            When that same model is connected to tools, APIs, or external systems and can autonomously decide when and how to use them to achieve goals, that’s what’s called Agentic AI.

            Breakdown:
            - GenAI (Generative AI):
                - Produces new content (text, images, audio, video).
                - Needs human prompts to guide it.
                - Example: Asking GPT-4 to write a poem or Stable Diffusion to generate an image.

            - Agentic AI:
                - Goes beyond generation — it can act.
                - Has autonomy: sets sub-goals, plans steps, calls tools, and executes workflows.
                - Example: An AI travel agent that, when asked “Book me a trip to Tokyo,” will:
                        - Search flights via APIs.
                        - Compare hotels.
                        - Reserve tickets.
                        - Send confirmations — all without step-by-step human prompting.

# Generative AI Model Naming by Modality

            - LLM (Large Language Model):
                - Text-focused generative AI.
                - Examples: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA.

            - VLM (Vision-Language Model):
                - Handles both images and text (multimodal).
                - Examples: GPT-4 with vision, Gemini, CLIP.

            - Diffusion Models / Image Generators:
                - Specialized in generating images.
                - Examples: Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, MidJourney.
                - Sometimes referred to as "Generative Image Models."

            - Audio Models:
                - Generate or transform speech, music, sound.
                - Examples: ElevenLabs (speech), Jukebox (music).
                - Often called "Generative Audio Models" or "Speech Synthesis Models."

            - Video Models:
                - Generate or edit video content.
                - Examples: Runway, Pika Labs, Sora.
                - Sometimes referred to as "Generative Video Models."

            - Multimodal Models:
                - Work across multiple input/output types (text + image + audio + video).
                - Examples: Gemini, GPT-4 multimodal.
                - Commonly called "Multimodal Generative Models."

            # Key Point
                - "LLM" is the standardized name for text models.
                - Other modalities don’t have one universal acronym like LLM, but terms such as:
                - VLM (Vision-Language Model)
                - Diffusion Models (images)
                - Generative Audio Models
                - Generative Video Models
                are widely used in research and industry.
