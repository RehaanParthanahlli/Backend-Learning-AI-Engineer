1. You started with a snippet:
   import { checkEnvironment } from "./utils.js"
   import OpenAI from "openai"
   checkEnvironment();

   - checkEnvironment likely validates environment variables (like OPENAI_API_KEY).
   - OpenAI is the official SDK for interacting with OpenAI’s API.

2. Installing OpenAI:
   - npm install openai
   - yarn add openai
   - pnpm add openai
   - Set OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment.

3. You saw an npm audit warning:
   - Reported a high severity vulnerability in "openclaw".
   - Suggested `npm audit fix --force` → upgrades openclaw@2026.2.13 (breaking change).

4. Clarification:
   - OpenAI SDK does NOT depend on openclaw.
   - openclaw is a completely separate package.
   - The audit warning appeared because openclaw was installed in your environment.

5. Investigation:
   - npm ls -g openclaw → showed nothing globally.
   - npm ls openclaw → showed openclaw@2026.2.13 invalid in C:\Users\rehaa\node_modules.
   - This happened because npm installed openclaw at the user directory level (no package.json in your project).

6. Fix:
   - npm uninstall openclaw (in C:\Users\rehaa).
   - Manually delete C:\Users\rehaa\node_modules\openclaw if needed.
   - Ensure no "openclaw" entry in package.json.
   - Work inside a proper project folder:
       mkdir backend-learn
       cd backend-learn
       npm init -y
       npm install openai
   - Verify with npm ls openai → should show only openai@latest.

7. Bottom line:
   - The vulnerability warnings are unrelated to OpenAI.
   - They come from a stray openclaw install in your user directory.
   - Cleaning it out and using a proper project setup with package.json fixes the issue.
