An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a toolbox provided by a company or platform to help developers build applications more easily.

Key Points:
- Contents: Libraries, APIs, documentation, sample code, debuggers, sometimes compilers.
- Purpose: Speeds up development with pre-built components and guidelines.
- Platform-Specific: Designed for a particular OS, hardware, or service.
  Examples:
    • Android SDK → build Android apps
    • iOS SDK → build iPhone/iPad apps
    • Java Development Kit (JDK) → build Java applications
- Extra Features: Some SDKs add analytics, ads, or push notifications.

SDK vs API:
| Aspect      | SDK                                      | API                                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition  | Full toolkit with libraries, docs, tools | Rules/interfaces to interact with software     |
| Scope       | Broad – helps build apps from scratch    | Narrow – enables communication between systems |
| Example     | Android SDK (emulator, debugger, libs)   | Google Maps API (embed maps in apps)           |

In short: An SDK helps you *build* software, while an API helps your software *talk* to other software.
