Hardcoded means written directly into the code instead of .env file.

For Setting up the request pattern remains same -

    1. Get API Key Simple for OpenAI and Groq but for OpenRouter you must do -
    
            free endpoints that may train on inputs
                Free model providers often retain and/or train on prompts and completions (applies to both chatroom and API usage). See the model page for details.


            Enable free endpoints that may publish prompts
                Allow free model providers to publish your prompts and completions to public datasets.

            But its an privacy issue ( incase of app handling user data)
    
    2. Ask the questions whats the URL for accessing this API Key.

    3. Model name as per the MP convention


Note:
[
    Write code in such a way that even if the model is down you can switch to other model easily using env var.
