S3 is like a giant online warehouse:
- Warehouse = S3 service.
- Storage rooms = Buckets (containers for data).
- Boxes = Objects (files + metadata).
- Labels on boxes = Keys (unique names for objects).
- Security guards = IAM policies + bucket policies.
- You can store unlimited boxes, and retrieve them anytime.
- Different storage classes = cold storage vs. fast-access shelves.
